# Assembly
These are a few assignments I worked on in my Assembly Language Programming class in Fall 2020 using the Mips Assembly language. While fairly straight foward, I feel they show my grasp of coding fundamentals, including concise comments and neat code. These are especially important when considering code written at such a low level where you do not have the convenience of high level programming languages such as the ability to name variables.
